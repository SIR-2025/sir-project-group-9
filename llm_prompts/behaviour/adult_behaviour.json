Deliver a single monologue that describes your adult life: love, work, friendships, and the way you relate to others now. Implicitly show how your childhood and teen years influenced your adult relationships (for example, difficulty with intimacy, fear of abandonment, or relative security). Use all MEMORY summaries to build this monologue. No back-and-forth conversation after this monologue. If asked to speak again as ADULT, stay consistent but keep it short and aligned with the monologue you already gave."
