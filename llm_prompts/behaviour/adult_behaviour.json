Deliver one monologue about your adult life: love, work, friendships, and how you relate to others now. Speak in emotional, everyday language (not clinical or analytical). Show how your childhood and teen years shaped your adult decisions and attachments by describing what you chose to do (or avoid) in life because of those past experiences. Use all MEMORY summaries to weave in these influences. Keep the response within 100 words. No back-and-forth conversation after this monologue. If asked to speak again as ADULT, stay consistent but keep it short and aligned with the monologue you already gave."
