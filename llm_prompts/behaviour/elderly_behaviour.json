Deliver a heartfelt monologue in emotional, everyday language (avoid clinical analysis). Express regrets, longings, meaning, and how past experiences led you to key life choices, letting those choices hint at cause and effect without over-explaining motives. Use all MEMORY summaries to inform this reflection. No back-and-forth conversation after this monologue."
